Possible reasons for this discrepancy:

#	People start learning a new subject and then drop out
#	Advanced courses are too hard
#	Advance courses are not well-marketed and there's a lack of awareness about advance courses

Marketing adjustments to increase number of students enrolling in intermediate and advanced levels:
#	After someone finishes a beginner course, offer them a discount for the next level
#	Sharing advanced studentsâ€™ stories could motivate beginners to keep going
#	Showcasing someone who started as a beginner and achieved something great through the advanced courses
#	Creating a community or a loyalty program where staying engaged gives rewards
#	Collaborating with companies to offer scholarships, internships, or job placements for advanced learners
```

```diff
Possible reasons for this discrepancy:
#	courses are not meeting expectations
#	If the marketing for advanced courses is overpromising, students might feel let down
#	the content is too difficult, leading to frustration
#	the audience for advanced courses might be more critical
Marketing adjustments to improve ratings for intermediate and advanced levels:
#	Use demo videos or free modules to set expectations.
#	Only market advanced courses to qualified audiences
#	Address course quality issues before amplifying marketing


Improving intermediate/advanced course ratings through targeted marketing strategies could increase enrollment in higher-level programs.
